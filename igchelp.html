            IGC Webview is a web based application for viewing logger traces in IGC format. Nearly all gliding loggers now either record
            in that format or save files in it- for any others including those not originally designed for gliding purposes,
            there are conversion programs out there; a popular example is <a href="http://www.gpsbabel.org">GPSBabel</a>.
            Igc files can normally be identified by the extension &quot;.igc&quot;.
        </p>
        <p>
            IGCWebview runs on a wide range of devices and operating systems; all you need is an internet connection and a browser with
            Javascript enabled. It uses world-wide mapping so can be used for flights made anywhere.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although designed to be as intuitive as possible, the program has one or two features you might miss, so please read this
            if you haven't used it before.
        </p>

        <h2>Getting started</h2>
        <p>Simple. Ignore the &quot;task&quot; setting for now. Click the &quot;Browse&quot; button and select an igc file from
            your local computer or device. On load a map will open up together with a barogram, and information from the
            file header will be displayed. The map will also show the location of any controlled/special use airspace in
            the area, if we have the data. If the file contains a task declaration this will also be shown on the map, together
            waypoint observation zones as defined in the FAI Sporting Code.
        </p>

        <h2>Altering the display</h2>
        <p>
            You can move around and zoom in or out on the map- if you've ever used Google Earth it works the same way. Click and drag
            to move; zoom in using the "+-" top left, scroll wheel, or on a tablet, "pinching". To reduce clutter you can
            control the airspace clip altitude, or lose the airspace display altogether. Click on the icon top right on the
            map to add or remove display of task or track, or to switch between map and satellite picture background.
        </p>

        <h2>Moving round the track</h2>
        <p>
            Use the slider control below the map to move the aircraft icon round the track. The text below the map will give the time
            and your position and altitude, and the crosshairs on the barogram will also show altitude and time flight. Times
            are time zone adjusted. If you find the aircraft is moving round too quickly for you and you have a keyboard,
            you can move it using the arrow keys, but you need to click on the slider first to give it focus. You can also
            click on the barogram; the glider will move to the point you've clicked on.
        </p>

        <h2>Tasks</h2>
        <p>
            If the task wasn't entered into the logger, you can enter one manually in the section headed &quot;Task- user entry&quot;.
            This can be done any time before or after loading the igc file. A wide range of formats is accepted. Any task
            entered here will override anything in the IGC file, so if you want to use the task in the file, ensure this
            section is empty.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Importing a task from  XCWebPlan</h2>
        <p>
           Users in the UK will find it easy to enter BGA trigraphs to define a task; for users elsewhere entering latitudes and longitudes by hand will work, but is a pain.  If you have a suitable waypoint file available (".cup" or ".dat" format), an easy alternative is to mark out your task in XCWebPlan, and import it.  The process is simpler than it looks provided you do it as per instructions:
           <ol>
           <li>Click on the "Load" button in the "Task user entry" section.  A copy of XCWebPlan will open in another tab in your browser.</li>
           <li>In XCWebPlan accept the airspace disclaimer and then select the waypoint file of your choice.</li>
           <li>Enter your task by clicking on the map.  If you haven't used XCWebPlan before, consult the help file that comes with it.</li>
           <li>Once you have entered the task a "Copy task" button will appear bottom right.  Click on it and you should get a message saying the task has been copied over.</li>
           <li>Switch back to the "XCWebView" tab, and you will see your new task entered.</li>
           <li>You can repeat the process as often as you like by simply switching back to the same tab with XCWebPlan on it.</li>
           </ol>
           Please note the process will only work if done as above; because there are very reasonable limitations on interaction between web pages for security reasons, it's a bit fiddly.  In particular, it will only work if you open the copy of XCWebPlan from the "Load" button- if it's opened by another route it won't recognise what it's supposed to be talking to (and you won't see the "copy task" button).  Also you will have to switch between tabs manually;  you won't see what's happening in the tab behind the current one, although we've provided messages which will hopefully tell you.</p>
        </p>
        
         <h2>Checking your performance</h2>
        <p>
            You can easily find out the speed you made around the task or how far short you were.  If you have both a task and an IGC file entered, click on the "Analyse task" button below the map.  If you completed the task it will show your speed; if you failed it will show your scoring distance (defined as the distance as far as the first failed turning point, minus the distance you were short of it).  A pin image will appear on the map marking your nearest approach to the failed point.
        </p>
        <p>
        Start, finish, and turning point sectors used in the calculation are defined as shown on the map.  If you want to use something else, you can change these (see below).
        </p>
        
         <h2>Control sectors</h2>
        <p>
           The defaults in the program are as follows:
           <ul>
           <li>Start:  A line radius 5 Km (ie: 10 Km long) centred at the start point, at right angle to the first leg.</li>
           <li>Turning points: A circle 0.5 Km radius centred on the point, <b> plus</b> a sector 20 Km radius subtending an angle of 90&deg; remote from and centred on the bisector of the tracks in and out (the "FAI thistle").</li>
           <li>Finish: A line of 1 Km radius at right angles to the last leg centred on the finish point.</li>
           </ul>
           If you want something else you can click on the "Configure TP sectors" button make changes, then click "Apply".  "Restore defaults" simply restores the values above, you still need to "apply" afterwards.  The values entered will always stick until you make a further change or close the page.  If you want them to apply next time you load the page, tick the "Save" box before "apply".
        </p>
