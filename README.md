# IGC Web View

This repository contains the original code for IgcWebview, a javascript application
for viewing igc files logged during glider flights.

The code has now been substantially re-written using [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).  Because of
the large number of code changes this required, it was felt necessary to start a new repository,
[IgcWebview2](https://github.com/GlidingWeb/IgcWebview2/).  This repository therefore is no longer active.

A production copy of IgcWebview (built from code in the IgcWebview2 repository) can be found at http://glidingweb.org.
