Table polyref    //master table for polygons:
Fields:
polynum:   integer  (3 byte) autoincrement primary key
country:   char(2)  //2 character country code- same as used for internet domains
name: varchar(30)  //identifying name of the airspace.  Not used by the application but useful to keep track
northlim:  double  //most northerly point of the polygon
southlim:  double  //most southerly point of the polygon
eastlim:  double  //most easterly point of the polygon
westlim:  double  //most westerly point of the polygon
base:  integer  unsigned (2 byte) //base of airspace in feet (assumes equivalence of feet and flight level)

Table polypoints  //actual points of the polygon
Fields:
polygon:  integer (3 byte)  //Foreign key linked on polyref(polynum). Joint index with point as primary key
point: integer (single byte) //point sequence for drawing polygon.  Joint index with polygon as primary key
coords: varchar(22)  //coordinates of the point already in string format: "[xx.xxxxx,xxx.xxxxx]".  Five decimal places
